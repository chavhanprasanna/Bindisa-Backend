# models

This folder contains all Mongoose models for MongoDB collections used in the Bindisa Backend.

- Each model defines the schema and structure for a resource (e.g., User.js, Crop.js).
- Models should only contain schema definitions and static/model methods.

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for environment variable and database setup.
