# controllers

This folder contains all route controller files for the Bindisa Backend. Controllers handle the business logic for each API endpoint, interacting with models and returning responses.

- Each controller file typically corresponds to a resource or feature (e.g., userController.js, cropController.js).
- Controllers should not contain direct database logic; use models for DB operations.
- Follow the projectâ€™s error handling and security conventions.

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for overall setup and usage.
