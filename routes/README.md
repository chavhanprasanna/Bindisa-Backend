# routes

This folder contains all Express route definitions for the Bindisa Backend.

- Each file defines endpoints for a specific resource or feature (e.g., auth.routes.js, crop.routes.js).
- Routes should delegate logic to controllers and use middleware for authentication, validation, etc.

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for API usage and endpoint documentation.
