This folder contains all Jest test files for the Bindisa Backend.

- Organize tests by feature or module (e.g., auth.test.js, crop.test.js).
- Use Jest for all unit and integration testing.
- Security tests are in `tests/security.test.js`.

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for running tests and testing conventions.
