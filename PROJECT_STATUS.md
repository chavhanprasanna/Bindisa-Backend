# Project Status: Bindisa Backend

## 1. Current Progress

- **Documentation:**
  - Comprehensive documentation (README.md) added to all major folders: controllers, models, routes, middleware, tests, utils, architecture, docs, config, scripts, tasks.
  - Main README.md is up to date with setup, features, security, and troubleshooting.
  - Soil_NPK_Analysis subproject has its own setup guide.

- **Codebase Structure:**
  - Modular organization: clear separation of controllers, models, routes, middleware, and utilities.
  - Security best practices implemented: helmet, rate limiting, JWT, CORS, sanitization, and more.
  - Automated testing setup with Jest; security tests included.

- **Features Implemented:**
  - Authentication (JWT, OTP via Twilio)
  - Dashboard and crop management
  - Soil testing and NPK analysis
  - Farming plan management
  - API documentation (Swagger)
  - Demo mode for development/testing

- **DevOps:**
  - Dockerfile and ecosystem.config.js for deployment
  - Environment variables managed with dotenv-safe

## 2. Planned/Future Work

- **Feature Expansion:**
  - More granular RBAC (role-based access control)
  - Advanced analytics and reporting for farm data
  - Integration with additional third-party APIs (e.g., weather, market prices)
  - Enhanced notification system (SMS, email)
  - Real-time updates/dashboard (WebSockets)
  - Improved error logging and monitoring

- **Testing & Quality:**
  - Increase test coverage (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

- **Documentation:**
  - Auto-generate API docs from code/comments
  - Add more usage examples and troubleshooting guides

## 3. Current Issues & Challenges

- **Git/GitHub Sync:**
  - Local branch is sometimes behind remote, causing push errors (requires `git pull` and conflict resolution).
  - Submodule warning for `Soil_NPK_Analysis`—should clarify if it is a true submodule or just a folder.

- **Large File Uploads:**
  - GitHub rejects files >100MB; need to use Git LFS for large datasets if required.

- **Line Ending Warnings:**
  - CRLF/LF warnings due to Windows/Linux differences (not critical, but can be noisy).

- **Merge Conflicts:**
  - Possible when multiple contributors work on overlapping files—need clear process for resolving and communicating conflicts.

- **Environment Management:**
  - `.env` files must not be committed; ensure secrets are kept out of version control.

---

**Summary:**
- The codebase is well-structured and documented.
- Key features are implemented and security is prioritized.
- Next steps focus on feature growth, quality, and developer experience.
- Current issues are mostly related to git workflow and collaboration, not code quality.
