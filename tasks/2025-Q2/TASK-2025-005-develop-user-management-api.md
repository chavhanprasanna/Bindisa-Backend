## Description
An internal-facing API for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user accounts was developed. This allows administrators to manage the user base.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `POST /users`: Creates a new user.
- `GET /users`: Returns a list of all users.
- `GET /users/:id`: Returns a single user by their ID.
- `PUT /users/:id`: Updates an existing user's information.
- `DELETE /users/:id`: Deletes a user from the database.

## Definition of Done
- All endpoints are implemented in `user.controller.js` and `user.routes.js`.
- API functionality is verified via Postman tests.
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.
